## üéØ Project Overview

This project is a hands-on introduction to designing a complete IoT product. The goal was to build a simple **AI Powered IoT Environmental Monitor** using an **ESP32** microcontroller. It demonstrates the full lifecycle of product development: from digital simulation to a physical, custom-designed PCB with real-world firmware.

**Key Features:**
* Reads sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity).
* Programmed using **MicroPython**, an easy-to-learn Python implementation for microcontrollers.
* Custom-designed PCB for a clean and robust final product.

## üöÄ The Workflow

We followed a 3-step process to take our idea from concept to reality.

### üîå Step 1: Simulation in WokWi

Before touching any physical hardware, we simulated the entire circuit and tested our initial code using the WokWi online simulator. This is a crucial step to validate the design and logic.

* **Find the simulation files in:** `1_Simulation_Wokwi/`
* **Or view the live project on Wokwi:** `[Link to your public Wokwi project]`

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Hardware & PCB Design in EasyEDA

Once the simulation was successful, we designed a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to house our components. This gives the project a professional and permanent form factor.

* **PCB project files are in:** `2_Hardware_EasyEDA/project_files/`
* **Gerber files for manufacturing are in:** `2_Hardware_EasyEDA/gerbers/`

### üíª Step 3: Firmware Development with MicroPython

With the physical hardware ready, the final step is to flash the ESP32 with the MicroPython firmware and upload our application script.

1.  **Flash MicroPython Firmware:** If your ESP32 is new, you first need to install the base MicroPython firmware. You can find instructions [here](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html).
2.  **Upload the Project Code:** Use a tool like Thonny IDE to upload the `main.py` and `boot.py` files from the `3_Firmware_Micropython/` directory to your ESP32.
